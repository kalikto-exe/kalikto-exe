# Kalikto (a.k.a. Smit Mehta)

I share practical technology knowledge focused on Android apps,
open-source tools, and real-world AI usage.

## What I write about
- Android app recommendations & comparisons
- Open-source alternatives to popular apps
- AI tools (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) with honest pros & cons
- Tech do’s and don’ts for everyday users

## Writing
- Medium: https://medium.com/@kalikto

## Philosophy
I prefer simple, privacy-respecting tools over feature-heavy apps.
