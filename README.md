# Kalikto (a.k.a. Smit Mehta)

I share practical technology insights focused on Android apps,
open-source tools, and real-world AI usage.

## What I focus on
- Android app recommendations & comparisons
- Open-source alternatives to popular apps
- AI tools (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) — honest pros & cons
- Tech do’s and don’ts for everyday users
- Coding and open source codes

## Writing & presence

## Community & learning
I enjoy discussing tech, sharing what I learn, and helping others
make better choices around apps, privacy, and everyday technology.

## Approach
I prefer simple, privacy-respecting tools over feature-heavy apps.
